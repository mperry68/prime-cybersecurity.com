                <h2>Why Phishing Training Matters</h2>
                <p>Phishing attacks remain one of the most common and effective methods cybercriminals use to breach organizations. These attacks target your employees through deceptive emails, messages, and websites designed to steal credentials, install malware, or extract sensitive information.</p>
                
                <p>Even with the best technical security controls in place, a single click from an unsuspecting employee can compromise your entire network. That's why comprehensive phishing awareness training is essential for any organization serious about cybersecurity.</p>
